## Setup overview

To interact with PlanetScale and manage your databases, you can use the `pscale` CLI to do the following:

- Create, delete and list your databases and branches
- Open a secure MySQL shell instance
- Manage your deploy requests
- ...and more!

<InfoBlock type="note">
  <inlineCode>pscale</inlineCode> can use the MySQL command-line client to
  quickly open an interactive shell for a database branch. Optional instructions
  for installing the MySQL client can be found for each platform below.

### macOS instructions

To install the PlanetScale CLI on macOS, we recommend using Homebrew.

How to install or verify Homebrew is on your computer:

1. Open Terminal.
2. Check if you have Homebrew installed by running the following command:

```zsh
brew -v
```

3. If you don't see "Homebrew" and a version number, then download and [install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
4. Once you've installed Homebrew, repeat _Step 2_ to verify.

**Installing via Homebrew**

- Run the following command:

```zsh
brew install planetscale/tap/pscale
```

- To install the MySQL command-line client:

```zsh
brew install mysql-client
```

### Linux instructions

`pscale` is available as downloadable binaries from the [releases](https://github.com/planetscale/cli/releases/latest) page.

Download the .deb or .rpm from the [releases](https://github.com/planetscale/cli/releases/latest) page and install with `sudo dpkg -i` and `sudo rpm -i` respectively.

The MySQL command-line client can be installed via your package manager.

- Debian-based distributions:

```
sudo apt-get install mysql-client
```

- RPM-based distributions:

```
sudo yum install community-mysql
```

**Manually**

Download the pre-compiled binaries from the [releases](https://github.com/planetscale/cli/releases/latest) page and copy to the desired location.

Instructions for installing the MySQL client on other Linux distributions can be found in the [official documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/linux-installation.html).

### Windows instructions

`pscale` is available as downloadable binary from the [releases](https://github.com/planetscale/cli/releases/latest) page. Download the latest Windows release and unzip the `pscale.exe` file into the folder of your choice. Then, run it from PowerShell or whatever terminal you regularly use.

The MySQL command-line client is available in the [Windows MySQL Installer](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/windows-installation.html). To launch `pscale shell` you will need to have the `mysql.exe` executable's directory in your shell's PATH.

In PowerShell, add that directory to your current shell's PATH:

```powershell
$env:path += ";C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin"
```

## Using the PlanetScale CLI

See all available commands by running:

```zsh
pscale --help
```

Verify that you're using the latest version:

```

You're all set!
