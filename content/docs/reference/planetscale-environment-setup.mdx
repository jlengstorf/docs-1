## Setup Overview
To interact with PlanetScale and manage your databases, you can use the `pscale` CLI to do the following:
- Create, delete and list your Databases and Branches

- ...and more!

### Mac instructions
To install the PlanetScale CLI on a Mac, we recommend using Homebrew. 

How to install or verify Homebrew is on your computer:
1. Open your Terminal.
2. Check if you have Homebrew installed by running the following command: 
```zsh
brew -v
```
3. If you don't see "Homebrew" and a version number, then download and [install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). 
4. Once you've installed Homebrew, repeat _Step 2_ to verify.

**Installing via Homebrew Tap**
- Run the following command:
```zsh
brew install planetscale/tap/pscale
```

```
