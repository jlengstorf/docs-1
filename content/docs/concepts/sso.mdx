## Overview
Single Sign-On (SSO) provides additional account security by allowing company administrators to require the use of an identity provider when logging into PlanetScale. Users only need to sign in once with a single set of credentials _(i.e. password and email)_ to access all of their tools and applications upon joining the company.

Furthermore, SSO allows an administrator to revoke someoneâ€™s access to all tools and applications from a single place when they leave a team or the company.

<b>A note:</b> SSO is only available as an <em>add-on</em> or as part of an <a href="https://docs.planetscale.com/concepts/billing#planetscale-plans">Enterprise plan</a>.
</InfoBlock>


## Enable SSO for your organization
[Contact](https://www.planetscale.com/contact) our sales team to get SSO enabled for your `organization`.

  
### Setup
When SSO is set up for your `organization`, all non-admin members are removed from the `organization`. Each `organization` [member](https://app.planetscale.com/planetscale/settings/members) must re-authenticate using SSO before they're automatically added back to the `organization`.

<InfoBlock  type="note">
<b>A note:</b> Organization administrators always remain in the <em>organization</em>, so they can configure SSO without losing access to the <em>organization</em>.
</InfoBlock>

After SSO has been enabled for your account, you can configure it under your PlanetScale `organization` settings: `app.planetscale.com/<org>/settings/sso`.

**Organization administrators** can _enable_, _configure_, and _disable_ SSO for all members of your `organization`.

Users can create multiple PlanetScale `organizations` _(i.e. work, personal, etc.)_, using the same email address, but that email address can only be associated with one SSO-enabled `organization`.


## Disabling SSO
When SSO is disabled for an `organization`, users can login with the password they initially set for their PlanetScale account. If they don't know their password, users can go through the password reset flow to regain access to their account.

Should a user lose access to the email address associated with that `organization`, they'll also lose access to their account after SSO is disabled.
