## Overview
At PlanetScale, we believe that you should only pay for what you use.

PlanetScale charges for database usage, `reads`/`writes`, and storage. You'll never have to over-provision resources or pay for resources that stand idle.

In addition, PlanetScale applies billing plans at the **database level**, allowing users to have _free_ and _paid_ databases within the same account.

### PlanetScale charges on three factors:
- **Reads**: inspecting rows during a query or mutation of any kind to your PlanetScale databases.
- **Writes**: adding new information or changing existing information in your PlanetScale databases. 
- **Storage**: data saved in the form of tables, columns, rows, and their corresponding relationships. 

## PlanetScale Plans
There is no minimum cost to deploy a PlanetScale database; you are only charged for your usage, as outlined below:

|                      | Developer:<br />Free | Scaler:<br />Pay as you grow | Enterprise: <br />Custom |
|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Storage**          | 10GB                 | $1.25 per 1GB                | Configurable             |
| **Read rows/month**  | 100m                 | $15 per 100m                 | Configurable             |
| **Write rows/month** | 10m                  | $15 per 10m                  | Configurable             |
| **Branches**         | 3                    | _Unlimited_                  | _Unlimited_              |

You have the option to upgrade/downgrade between the `Developer`_(free)_ and `Scaler` plans. Upgrading to the `Scaler`_(pay as you scale)_ plan merely requires adding your credit card information to your billing page. For more information about the `Enterprise` plan, please [contact](https://www.planetscale.com/contact) our sales team.

## Find your database billing page 
Each PlanetScale database has its own billing page, from which you can:
 - Enter/update your credit card information. 
 - Upgrade/downgrade between billing plans. 
 - See a history of your invoices, as well as the current invoice. 

PlanetScale itemizes the database usage in your invoices each month. Invoices live under the databaseâ€™s billing page:`/organization/database/settings/usage`. 

**PlanetScale invoice details:**
 - Invoices provide line items for both usage and discounts received.

 - Each line item shows both metric and database branch level granularity. (i.e. **Rows** _read_ for `main` branch, **rows** _read_ for `your-test-branch`, etc.)

 - Storage per branch has two line items:
    - One for storage usage.
    - One for prorated discounts, if the branch existed for a smaller time period than the billing period.

 - Storage is prorated by a percentage equal to the existence of a branch's hours/billing period in hours.


## Download invoice
You have the option to download invoices as a _PDF_ or _CSV_ file. 

Go to `Organization > Database > Settings > Usage` and search the billing page for the _Invoices_ section.

  A note: PlanetScale generates both current and past invoices. Even for the <b>free</b> plan! You can see the cost had you not been on the developer plan.

## Usage and usage limits
Each PlanetScale plan provides different feature and usage limits. If you accidentally surpass your plan's limits, you'll receive a warning notification and your database will be marked as in overage. If you do not upgrade your plan within 7 days of receiving the notification, PlanetScale will "degrade service" to your database by putting it into `read only` mode. At this point, all `writes` are disabled and all _migrations_ are halted.

When placed in `read only` mode, the databases you have deployed in PlanetScale and any data they contain, are not impacted by this change. `Writes` are disabled, and all branch/database creation is temporarily halted. 

<InfoBlock type="warning">
  Warning: Your PlanetScale service only gets throttled if your usage exceeds the limits designated within your plan.
