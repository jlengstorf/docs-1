## Overview
Query statistics give you insight into the active queries running against your databases. This allows you to identify queries that are running too frequently, returning too large of a result set, or require an index to return results more quickly.

## Available statistics

- **Table** — The table, or tables for a join, being queried or modified.
- **Count** — The number of times this query has run.
- **Time** — The total amount of time this query has run, in milliseconds.
- **Rows affected** — The number of rows modified by an insert, update, or delete statement.
- **Rows returned** — The number of rows fetched by a select statement.
- **Time per query** — The number of milliseconds each individual query takes to run. This is calculated from total time divided by count.
