## Overview

The organization audit log grants organization administrators access to review **actions** performed by individual members of the organization. In addition, each audit log includes **events** detailing who performed the **action** and when it happened.

Audit log events are retained for 15 days in your PlanetScale account.

## Review your organization audit log

You can review your organization audit log under your PlanetScale **organization** settings: `app.planetscale.com/<org>/settings/audit-log`.

Once there, you can filter the audit log by **Actor** and/or **Action**.

Clicking and expanding individual log **event** names empowers you to investigate additional metadata that can provide broader context around what changed.
