## Overview
The Security log gives you insight into recent authentication and other security-related `actions` for your account. Your Security log also details when you performed each `action`.

Security log events are retained for 15 days in your PlanetScale account.


## Review your Security log
You can review your Security log in your PlanetScale account settings.

1. Go to your [PlanetScale Security log](https://app.planetscale.com/settings/security-log) page.

Once there, you can filter your Security log by `Action`.
