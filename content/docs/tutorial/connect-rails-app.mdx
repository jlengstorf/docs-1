## Introduction

In this tutorial, we’re going to create a simple Rails application named _blog_ and connect it to a PlanetScale database. First, we’ll perform a simple table migration from our local Rails application to our PlanetScale database. Then we'll merge that schema request into our production branch using PlanetScale's CLI.

## Prerequisites

- Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).
- Install the [PlanetScale CLI](https://github.com/planetscale/cli).
- Authenticate the CLI with the following command:

```zsh
pscale auth login
```

## Create a Rails project

To connect a Rails application to a PlanetScale database, we start by creating a sample Rails project named _blog_ and installing the libraries we'll need to connect to our PlanetScale database.

Open the command line and follow these steps:

1. Create a rails app named _blog_ by running the following command:

```zsh
rails new blog
```

2. Change into the directory you just created, the `blog` Rails app:

```zsh
cd blog
```

3. Let's add some gems to our _Gemfile_:

- Update your source _Gemfile_ by running the following command from the _blog_ directory:

```zsh
blog$ vim Gemfile
```

- Add the following requirements in your Ruby _Gemfile_:

```ruby
gem "planetscale"
gem "mysql2"
```

4. Install our _Gemfile_ dependencies:

```zsh
blog$ bundle install
```

At this point, we have accomplished two things: we've created a rails project called _blog_ and installed the libraries that we'll need to connect to our PlanetScale database. Now it’s time to create a PlanetScale Database.

## Create a PlanetScale Database

1. Using the `pscale` shell, create a new database named _blog_:

```zsh
blog$ pscale database create blog
```

That's it! Because we're a Rails app, we can go into the web UI and enable "Automatic Rails Migrations" in the database's settings page.

## Configure Rails and PlanetScale

Now that the `planetscale` gem is installed, let's configure our application to talk to PlanetScale.

1. Use the Rails generator to add the appropriate configuration to our new app (substituting in your organization name):

```zsh
blog$ bundle exec rails generate planetscale:install --organization $ORG_NAME
```

2. Open `config/database.yml` and configure our `development` database settings:

```yaml
development:
  <<: *default
  adapter: mysql2
  username: root
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 3305
  database: blog
```

<InfoBlock type="note">
  A Note: This will tell your Rails app to connect to the proxy our PlanetScale
  gem will automatically boot up.
</InfoBlock>

## Migrate your database

Here comes the fun stuff! Now that your application is configured to talk to PlanetScale, we can create our first [non-blocking schema change](../concepts/nonblocking-schema-changes).

1. Create a development PlanetScale branch and switch to it:

```zsh
blog$ pscale branch create blog add-users-table
```

2. Switch to your newly created branch:

```zsh
blog$ pscale branch switch add-users-table --database blog
```

This configures the proxy to use your new development branch.

3. Create a normal Rails migration and call it `CreateUsers`:

```zsh
blog$ rails generate migration CreateUsers
```

4. This rails command begins the migration for our table that is currently empty and generates a Ruby file that’ll be named something like this:
   `create db migrate/834743749_create_users.rb`

5. We can fill in the body of this skeleton file with a few more relevant details, such as a user's **name** and **email**.

```ruby
class CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]
    def change
        create_table :users do |t|
        t.string :name
        t.string :email
        t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

6. Let's run our migration:

```zsh
blog$ bin/rails db:migrate
```

<InfoBlock type="tip">
  Tip: If you run into a proxy ERROR stating that address is already in use, run
  the following command: <em>spring stop</em>. (Spring is a Ruby library that
  pre-loads and runs all of our code into memory, detecting when our source code
  has changed.) Then, try the above command again.
</InfoBlock>

7. Now give it a whirl to make sure we can query the new table with our `pscale` cli:

```zsh
blog$ pscale shell blog add-users-table
```

```sql
blog/add-users-table> show tables;
+----------------------+
| Tables_in_blog       |
+----------------------+
| ar_internal_metadata |
| schema_migrations    |
| users                |
+----------------------+
blog/add-users-table> describe users;
+------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field      | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| id         | bigint       | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
| name       | varchar(255) | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| email      | varchar(255) | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| created_at | datetime(6)  | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
| updated_at | datetime(6)  | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
+------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
```

## Deploy your Migration

Now that your Rails migration is live on a PlanetScale branch, let's get it back into `main`.

1. Create a _Deploy Request_ in the CLI:

```zsh
blog$ pscale deploy-request create blog add-users-table
Deploy request #1 successfully created.
```

2. Look at the `diff` to make sure things seem right:

```zsh
blog$ pscale deploy-request diff blog 1
-- ar_internal_metadata --
+CREATE TABLE `ar_internal_metadata` (
+  `key` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
+  `value` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
+  `created_at` datetime(6) NOT NULL,
+  `updated_at` datetime(6) NOT NULL,
+  PRIMARY KEY (`key`)
+) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
-- schema_migrations --
+CREATE TABLE `schema_migrations` (
+  `version` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
+  PRIMARY KEY (`version`)
+) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
-- users --
+CREATE TABLE `users` (
+  `id` bigint NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
+  `name` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
+  `email` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
+  `created_at` datetime(6) NOT NULL,
+  `updated_at` datetime(6) NOT NULL,
+  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
+) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
```

3. Merge it into `main`:

```zsh
blog$ pscale deploy-request deploy blog 1
Successfully deployed b0lr4nphv6y3 from add-users-table to main.
```

4. Take a look at what `main` looks like:

```zsh
blog$ pscale shell blog main
```

```sql
blog/main> show tables;
+----------------------+
| Tables_in_blog       |
+----------------------+
| ar_internal_metadata |
| schema_migrations    |
| users                |
+----------------------+

blog/main> select * from schema_migrations;
+----------------+
| version        |
+----------------+
| 20210517233759 |
+----------------+

blog/main> describe users;
+------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field      | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| id         | bigint       | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
| name       | varchar(255) | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| email      | varchar(255) | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| created_at | datetime(6)  | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
| updated_at | datetime(6)  | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
+------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
```

5. Tell the client to switch back to `main`:

```zsh
blog$ pscale branch switch main
```

Congratulations! You're ready to develop your Rails application against PlanetScale.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we created a simple Rails application named _blog_ and connected it to PlanetScale’s database and branching environments. We performed a schema migration from our Rails application to a PlanetScale development branch, and then merged that branch back into production. We saw that PlanetScale rolled our schema change out, and copied over the record of Rails' schema migration as well.

## What's next?

Now that you've successfully connected your Rails app to PlanetScale, it's time to make more schema changes to your tables! Learn more about how PlanetScale allows you to make [non-blocking schema changes](/concepts/nonblocking-schema-changes) to your database tables without locking or causing downtime for production databases.
